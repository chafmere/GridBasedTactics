This project is designed to demostrate how you might create a 3D Grid Based Tactics Game. Godot Has support for Grid a star movement but only for 2D. In 3D requires a few tricks to get the movement from Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem path of radience.

Feel Free to pick apart for your learning purposes. Pay special attention to AStarGrid3D.gd and The world manager script. In order to get the movement aesthetic you must arrage the grid without diagonal connections and tweak the a star cost algorithm to favour x or z directions.
